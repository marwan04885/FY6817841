 This article talks about the science of flight and what forces are involved when planes fly.It covers how 
 over the years planes have been altered and manipulated to make changes to make flight safer and easier some
 of these changes includes the design of the plane and what materials have been used to make it. This article 
 also goes in depth on drag and how it can be easily modified to reduce this and covers how velocity of a fluid 
 increace and its pressure decreaces with proof using a simple experiment that you could do at home.

What is air and how does it help planes fly? Air is just a physical substances that has weight and many
unique properties. This air produces a force that can lift an object. The two important ones are its 
pressure and temperature, which are controlled by the altitude. Atmospheric pressure is just the force 
on an object exerted by the weight of the air above it.Pressure and altitude are inversly proportional,
meaning if the altitude increaces, the pressure drops, and when the pressure drops, the temperature of
the air molecules will drop too.The pressure difference in airplanes is very important for airplanes, as 
molecules movefrom high to low pressure.This means that it will generate an upward force on the 
plane wing; this is called lift.
<img src=“mm.png” alt=“Plane Image”>

This diagram shows that pressure is higher below the plane, and this willl make the air molecules rise,
which results in the lift. The bigger the difference in air pressure, the greater the force. Also, the 
greater the surface area of the wing, the greater the lift force, as more molecules will collide with the
bottom of the plane.Most aeroplanes are desginged as aerofoils to minimize drag while generating as much 
lift as possible

To create this pressure, difference the aerofoil has been mainipulated over years. The two main ways that 
this is generated is when the wing surface is cambered (curved) and inclined relative to the airflow direction.

So, what is the reason for the upper surface to be more curved? 
This is because it would provide a longer path for the aerofoil; this would lead to a drop in pressure in the area
above the aerofiol and an increse in pressure below the airfoil. This would generate lift, allowing the plane to travel
at a higher velocity. As Bernoulli discoverd, velocity increases in a fluid, and the pressure decreaces.However, Bernoulli 
discovered that the plane would just keep on rising and not be able to stay at a constant altitude. This is when the angle of
attack comes into play, which is just the angle of between the direaction of airflow and the chord. This is controlled 
manipulate the plane to travel at different speed. The faster the plane travels, the smaller the angle needs.

To prove that the velcoity of a fluid increases and its presssure decreaces, we could do a simple experiment called the straw minster
experiment.Get a cup of water and two straws, the place one straw in the water and the ohter one at a 90-degree angle to the first strawm as
shown in the diagram below. Then, when you blow into the straw, the air's velocity will increace, causing a pressure drop which results in the
water travelling up the other straw and spraying away from the stream of air being blow accross the straw. This is due to fluids moving 
from high to low pressure.

Bernoulli was a physician and mathematician that published many theories but he's most well know for his hydrodynamic book that contains
his studies about pressure and velocity in fluids. Using his discovery, we were able to produce an equation for lift:

        s=surface area of the wing
        L=lift
        C=Coefficient of lift 
        P=Air density 

Its' great to travel at high speed to reach our destination, but there's always a limit to how fas we go for aeroplanes, this limit
is determined by the drag, which is the resistive force that opposes the forward force thrust.There are two main type of drag-parasite
drag and induced Drag.
        
Parasite drag is essentially all the forces that slow donw the aircraft movement.They have the main types: form drag, interference drag,
 and skin friction. Form drag is a type of drag that can be decreased by making things more aerodynamic, meaining they can slice through the air
 more easily.This means less drag is created.
        
The second form of drag is called skin friction, and this essentially means the materials being used to build the plane. The surface of that 
aeroplanes is rigged to a certain degree, no matter how smooth it look or feels, air molecules will be colliding with the surface of the plane, 
and the rougher the surface is, the more collision with the aircraft. To reduce draag as much as possible, aircraft start using a special coating 
that protects the surface from harsh weather conditions and makes it less vulnerable to skin friction drag.

The form of drag is called induced drag, and it is when air vortexes are created at the tip of the plane's wings. Theses vortexes interact with the
aerofoils and produce difference between the front and the back of the plane. This lead to a pressure difference that opposes the forward motion 
of the aerofoil.This can be reduce by changing the ratio of the wingspan to the width of the wing.The larger the ratio, the less the induce drag because
aeroplanes with a low wing aspect ratio produces fewer wingtip vortices.
